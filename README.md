# Okta CIS Embedded flows
This repository contains a sample web application built using the Okta Identity Engine Embedded SDKs that use the interaction code grant type to demonstrate the following functionality:
 
* User Login
* Registration
* Social Login
* Federated Login
* Password reset
* MFA Enrollment (SMS)
* MFA Challenge & Verification (SMS)
* Logout

The sample illustrates the above functionality using both the Okta Sign in widget (https://github.com/okta/okta-signin-widget) and custom web pages that use the OIE Embedded Java SDK (https://github.com/okta/okta-idx-java)

You can use this application to demonstrate these flows to a prospect or a customer that has a business partner apps use case, which requires embedded login & registration flows using either the Okta sign-in widget or custom built pages

*Disclaimer: To avoid relying on 3rd party cookies, a custom domain needs to be configured for the Okta tenant that has the same parent domain as the application.*
