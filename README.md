This repository contains a sample web application built using the Okta Identity Engine SDKs to demonstrate the following functionality:
 
* User Login (w/MFA)
* Registration
* Social Login
* Login with an enterprise IDP
* Password reset
* MFA Enrollment (SMS)
* Logout

The sample illustrates the above functionality using both the Okta Sign in widget (https://github.com/okta/okta-signin-widget) and custom web pages that use the Okta SDK (https://github.com/okta/okta-idx-java)
